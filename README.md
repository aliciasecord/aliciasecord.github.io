*Part portfolio. Part spellbook. Entirely a work in progress.*

## ✨ About the Artist
Hi folks! I'm Alicia Secord (she/her/hers or fae/faem/faers), the front-end technologist behind this particular curtain. I'm nowhere near done learning and growing and evolving as a developer and as a human, and this profile reflects that in real time.  

🔭 I’m currently working on building my personal website ecosystem in this repo.
🌱 I’m currently learning [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) for making apps. Learnings: [learn-react](https://github.com/aliciasecord/learn-react).
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my home-grown household management platform, [head-of-house](https://github.com/aliciasecord/head-of-house)
💬 Ask me about blending tech with creativity, ritual, and the divine
⚡ Fun fact: I organize my house like an RPG dungeon map because gamifying chores actually works. I am writing a rulebook to go with it.

## 💼 About the Repo
This repository contains the source code for my personal website.
It also serves as the featured repository on my GitHub profile.

At a glance, this project highlights:
- Strong front-end architecture
- Modern CSS (design tokens, layers, utilities)
- Modular HTML/JS partial loading
- A custom design system unique to this site
- Accessibility-first and responsive patterns

If you're evaluating my work, feel free to browse the structure, patterns, and approach.

## 🌙 About the Website
This is my personal playground. It's the crossroads where practical magic and professional projects collide and spin off into new ideas. I spend my days building clean, thoughtful digital experiences and my nights trying to keep plants alive, raise small humans, and make sense of the world like everyone else. This site is a grimoire-in-progress: prototypes, experiments, musings, and the tiny rituals that make tech (and life) feel more intuitive, more connected, more human.

### 🛠 Tech & Architecture
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- CSS @layer architecture (reset → tokens → utilities → elements → modules → pages)
- Design tokens (raw + semantic)
- Flexbox utilities
- Dark/light mode via custom properties
- JavaScript partials loader for `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, sidebars
- GitHub Pages for hosting

### 🌐 Functions
- A living portfolio
- A digital garden
- A writing space
- A home for projects, spells, experiments, and notes

It’s an evolving creation that blends my technical practice with my creative life.
